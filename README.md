Part one:
- Task to be done
  - required field
- Date to be done by
  - Date must be DD/MM/YY format
  - optional field
- submit button

On submit, display on the page. 

Part two:
When you hover over a task item, it should change style to show it is clickable (e.g. border, background, or box-shadow).
When you click the task, it should open a modal (a box on the screen) with a button to remove the task.
If you click the button, it should remove the task from the list.

Part three:
Add another button to mark the task as complete.
If the task is complete, it should be moved from the list of tasks To Do, to a section for Done tasks.

Part four:
If a task is done, add a date of when it was marked as done (not the date from the form)

Part 5:
If the deadline for a task is in the past, highlight the task in red if it is in the To Do section.
